# 🔧 **COMPREHENSIVE FIXES APPLIED**

## ✅ **MAJOR ISSUES FIXED**

### 1. **New Chat Button Fixed**
- **Problem**: Button wasn't working properly
- **Solution**: 
  - Added proper error handling and loading states
  - Fixed event listener registration
  - Added visual feedback during operation
  - Proper session cleanup and page reload

### 2. **Chat History Duplication Eliminated**
- **Problem**: Multiple identical chats appearing in history
- **Solution**:
  - Added duplicate detection based on chat ID and content similarity
  - Limited history to 30 chats maximum for performance
  - Improved chat saving logic with proper error handling
  - Only save chats with meaningful content (at least 1 user message)

### 3. **Rate Limiting System Implemented**
- **Problem**: "Rate limit exceeded" errors causing retries and chaos
- **Solution**:
  - Built comprehensive `RateLimiter` class
  - Conservative limits: 5 requests/minute, 50,000 tokens/minute
  - Proper error handling for rate limit responses
  - Frontend shows user-friendly rate limit messages
  - No automatic retries that compound the problem

### 4. **Sandbox Cleanup Optimized**
- **Problem**: Sandbox directories accumulating and causing issues
- **Solution**:
  - Clean ALL sandboxes on server restart
  - Automatic cleanup every 5 minutes
  - Delete sandboxes older than 10 minutes (not 1 hour)
  - Moved sandbox to system temp directory
  - Proper error handling for cleanup failures

### 5. **Error Handling Completely Overhauled**
- **Problem**: Generic error messages and poor error recovery
- **Solution**:
  - Specific error messages for different failure types
  - Rate limit errors handled gracefully
  - Connection errors with retry suggestions
  - Timeout errors with user-friendly messages
  - Automatic removal of failed user messages from chat

### 6. **Chat Loading System Fixed**
